🎨 Frontend Development Next Steps
Your frontend has basic structure but needs implementation. I recommend this order:

UI Component Library - Build/enhance reusable components
Dashboard Implementations - Role-specific dashboards (admin, learner, writer, customer)
Public Pages - Home, About, Courses, Shop, Blog, Contact
E-commerce Flow - Product browsing, cart, checkout
Learning Platform - Course enrollment, lesson viewing, progress tracking
Blog/Content - Article listing, reading, commenting
User Profile - Settings, avatar, preferences
Would you like me to:

Start with the UI component library (buttons, forms, cards, modals)?
Implement a specific dashboard (which role)?
Build out the homepage and public pages?
Set up a specific feature (shop, courses, or blog)?
What would you like to tackle first?
